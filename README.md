# AbbreviationMaker
Shiny app to make an abbreviation list from all the abbreviations in a document.

This saves time over going through manually and putting a list together yourself.

Also, this app can automatically guess definitions. Currently relies on webscraping.

TK: more polite version. Use a cached version of the HUGO gene names, the NCBI API, and the STANDS4 abbreviation API.
TK: more full-featured version, letting you select abbreviations.com subcategories to guess from.
TK: use the promises package to add async handling, to make it practical for more than a handful of people to use at once.
